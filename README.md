# Jeremy Doran's Professional Portfolio


## Description

This is my portfolio of accomplished work. I have included projects and achievements from other areas of my professional life in order to give a more complete image of the type of person that I am. I hope to always be a student who is bold enough to try new things but always humble enough to learn from those around me, wether student, instructor, other professionals, or just from experimenting. This portfolio is starting off with somewhat simplistic design so that I am able to focus on the contents within it better. At the time of creating this portfolio, I am finding myself towards the bottom of the skills matrix when it comes to the class I am a part of, but I believe with more iterations of the designs I attempt to build, my skills will continue to grow.
