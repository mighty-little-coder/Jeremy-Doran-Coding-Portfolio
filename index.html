        <section class="bio">
            <p>My professional career started off as a classically trained ballet dancer where I was a featured performer in a traveling dance company. We performed on Broadway in NY, in Houston Texas, Chicago Michigan, and in various Rhode Island, Massachusets and Connecticut festivals. Simultaneously, I was attending trade school and started a career as an automotive technician attaining ASE and manufacturer certifications. As recently as 2020, I moved into the aerospace industry where i have had the chance to travel doing machine installation and repairs in areas like Rives-en-Seine, France and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I also received training in customer service, laser and metal fabrication machine programming which is where I discovered how much I enjoy programming and development. Amongst other hobbies such as videography, #D Printing, and racecar building, I am always in search of opportunities to learn, grow and explore!</p>

<!-- AS AN employer
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

    GIVE   N I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport -->
